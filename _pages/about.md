My research lies at the intersection of electromagnetics and wireless communication.  
I aim to develop computational** and intelligent methods that deepen our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and enable its transformative use in the connected world of the future.

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Sichuan University–Pittsburgh Institute, Sichuan University, China.  
I received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from University College Dublin, Ireland, in 2024.
