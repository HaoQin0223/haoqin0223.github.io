# 👋 About Me

My research lies at the intersection of **electromagnetics** and **wireless communication**.  
I aim to develop **computational** and **intelligent methods** that deepen our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and enable its **transformative use in the connected world of the future**.

I am currently an **Assistant Professor** at the **Sichuan University–Pittsburgh Institute**, Sichuan University, China.  
I received the **B.Eng.** and **M.S.** degrees from the **Harbin Institute of Technology**, Harbin, China, in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and the **Ph.D.** degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from **University College Dublin**, Ireland, in 2024.
